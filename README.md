# RMT IS OK!

As part of expressing my personal opinion on RMT as a whole industry within MMORPGs (for gold/items, don't buy accounts...), this Repo contains scripts for:

`Path of Exile`

### Methodology

1. Scrape `poe.trade` for exchange data Divine -> Chaos, Exalt -> Chaos
2. Scrape RMT site for cost of said currency.
3. Do some transformations on the data. Enforce constraints, etc.
4. Save as CSV
5. Ideally you'd put this in a DB and run on a schedule but that is your own perogative!

### Disclaimer

While I recommend RMTing for Gold/Currency and Items for those interested, I will not say that you _should_ go out and spend money.

If you decide to spend money in the RMT industry please understand that you will be in immediate violation of most-if-not-all game's TOS/EULA.

Like it or not this could lead to termination of your account. I will not be giving out advice on how to avoid Termination. Do your own research and buy within your risk tolerance.

If you do end up getting banned, remember this is only _**informational**_ -- I did not click "Checkout" for you, did not enter your card info, and did not take delivery of any "illicit" currencies.

Feel free to make Forks and make changes. Do not PR in this Repo, I will not be taking outside PRs.

### Message to RMT Vendors

Please do not try to message me to be added to the "trusted sellers" list. I will add people as I see fit and, if you message me, I will _never_ add you.

### License Info

Unlicense. Go crazy.
